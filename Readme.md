## A Little Info about HTML
#### Headers in HTML:
Below is how you would get started, every HTML page needs a header to specify formatting and can import stylesheets made in .css file, javascript for unique functionality and interactivity for the users.

Use the starting tag `<head>` and ending tag `</head>`
```HTML
<html>
  <head>
      <script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/2dcf4e58a9.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="../jquery.visible.js"></script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="stars.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">    
  </head>
</html>
```
Basically in the head you can reference many different stylesheets (from .css file) as well as interactive buttons, moving logos, animations through .js (javascript) file types. More information is in the actual code.

#### The Body in HTML:

Body tags contain everything that is displayed on the website. This is the bulk of the code. We used many online resources to help create the website.

Use the starting tag `<body>` and ending tag `</body>` to specify that you are in the body

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <!--- Some information --->
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <!--- Everything included in webpage --->
    </body>
</html>
```

#### Javascript in HTML:
Javascript, as said before, allows interactivity between the website and user. It is what you see when you hover over certain objects and when you click on certain buttons. 

Use the starting tag `<script>` and ending tag `</script>` to specify that you are working with javascript

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <!--- Some information --->
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <!--- Everything included in webpage --->
    </body>
    
    <script>
        <!--- Everything javascript related goes in here --->
    </script>
</html>
```
